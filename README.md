# Card Fraud Detector

Consider the following credit card fraud detection algorithm:
A credit card transaction is comprised of the following elements;
hashed credit card number
timestamp - of format 'year-month-dayThour:minute:second'
price - of format 'dollars.cents'

Transactions are to be received as a comma separated string of elements eg. '10d7ce2f43e35fa57d1bbf8b1e2, 2014-04-29T13:15:54, 10.00'

A credit card will be identified as fraudulent if the sum of prices for a unique hashed credit card number, for a given day, exceeds the price threshold T.

Write a method on a class, which, when given a list transactions, a date and a price threshold T, returns a list of hashed credit card numbers that have been identified as fraudulent for that day. Feel free to create any additional classes you need to support the design of your solution. adding up

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the cardFraudDetector up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Java 1.8

Maven


### Build

open a command console into the cardFraudDetector folder and run the following
```
mvn clean package
```
this will run all the unit tests then compile the class file and build the jar file under /target directory


### Running the tests

automated tests are under /src/test/java/com/cardfraud/AppTest.java
they can be run with 
```
mvn test
```

## Running the application

the cardFraudDetector-1.jar under target folder has to be run with 3 arguments :
a file containing a list of transaction ( see transaction_file_example file under cardFraudDetector folder)
an amount threshold
a date

for example :
open a command console into the cardFraudDetector folder and run the following
```
java -jar .\target\cardFraudDetector-1.jar transaction_file_example 10 2014-04-29
```

main class is DetectionRunner.java

feel free to run the app with other files and play with the arguments.

Note that you can import the project as a maven project into eclipse and run the tests with Junit 

## Further dev idea

### Refactor code according to S.O.L.I.D principle
